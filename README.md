ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

A simple and interactive web application that recommends movies based on cast and crew information. Built with Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn, it uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to find movies similar to a user-input title.

Features

User-friendly interface using Streamlit.

Accepts any movie title present in the dataset.

Recommends the top 500 movies with similar cast and crew.

Fast and efficient search using TF-IDF vectorization.

Provides insight into movies that are contextually similar based on people involved in the production.

How It Works

1. Load Dataset: Reads a CSV/ZIP file containing movie information including title, cast, and crew.


2. Combine Text Data: Combines cast and crew into a single text field for analysis.


3. TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts textual data into numerical vectors using TF-IDF, ignoring common English stopwords.


4. Cosine Similarity: Computes similarity between movies based on their cast and crew vectors.


5. Recommendation Function: Returns the top 500 movies similar to the entered movie title.


6. Streamlit Interface: Provides a clean, interactive UI for users to enter a movie name and see recommendations instantly.

Usage

1. Open a terminal in the project folder.


2. Run the Streamlit app:



python -m streamlit run movie_app.py

3. A browser window will open with the app interface.


4. Enter a movie title (exact title from the dataset) and click Recommend.


5. The app will display the top 500 similar movies based on cast and crew similarity.

Dataset

The project uses the TMDb 5000 Movie Dataset, which includes:

Movie titles

Cast details

Crew details

Example Movie Titles (from dataset)

The Dark Knight

Avatar

Inception

The Avengers

Jurassic Park


> Note: You must type the movie title exactly as it appears in the dataset to get recommendations.

Future Improvements

Include movie genres, keywords, and descriptions for more accurate recommendations.

Add poster images in the Streamlit app for a better visual experience.

Implement user rating-based filtering to refine recommendations.

Allow fuzzy search to accept partial movie titles instead of exact matches.
